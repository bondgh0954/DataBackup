# DataBackup

# Technologies used: 
Python: Boto3 library
AWS

# Project Description:
Write a Python script that automates creating backups for EC2 Volumes <br/>
Write a Python script that cleans up old EC2 Volume snapshots <br/>
Write a Python script that restores EC2 Volumes   <br/>

# Introduction and motivation of the Project:
1. Why is creation of snapshot of volumes for EC2 instances important <br/>

Volumes are AWS Storage Components that stores EC2 instance data and every EC2 has volumes where it writes its data. <br/>
   
The creation of 'snapshots'is important due to the risk of data corruption. <br/>
Snapshot creation is the generation of a comprehensive backup of EC2 instance data  <br/>
which enables seamless data recovery if the original volumes become corrupted or compromised. <br/>

Additionally, these snapshots can be employed to produce new volumes when needed. <br/>


The fundamental importance of snapshots in maintaining data integrity and continuity underpins the motivation for this project."
